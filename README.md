## 🔌 Outage Integration Setup

### Overview

The outage integration helps you manage scheduled power outages (rolling blackouts) by:
1. **Monitoring** current outages and battery sufficiency
2. **Predicting** if you can charge before the next outage
3. **Alerting** you when action is needed
4. **Displaying** your outage schedule

### Compatible Integrations

#### ⚡️ HA Yasno Outages (Recommended for Ukraine)

For users in Ukraine affected by electricity outages, we recommend the [**HA Yasno Outages**](https://github.com/denysdovhan/ha-yasno-outages) integration by [@denysdovhan](https://github.com/denysdovhan).

**Features:**
- 📅 Automatic outage schedule tracking for all Ukrainian regions
- 🔌 Real-time electricity status monitoring
- ⏰ Next planned outage predictions
- 🏢 Supports multiple providers (DTEK, Yasno)
- 📊 Calendar view of planned outages

**Installation:**
1. Install via HACS (search for "Yasno Outages")
2. Configure your city and DTEK group
3. Use the provided sensors in your card configuration

**Sensor mapping for this card:**
- `sensor.yasno_*_electricity` → `outage_status_entity`
- `sensor.yasno_*_next_connectivity` → `outage_end_time_entity`
- `sensor.yasno_*_next_planned_outage` → `next_outage_time_entity`

*Replace `*` with your specific city and group (e.g., `kiiv_dtek_2_2`)*

---

### Required Sensors

To use outage features, you need to create template sensors in your Home Assistant configuration. Here are examples:

#### Example 1: Simple Scheduled Outages

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      # Outage Status - assumes daily outage from 14:00-16:00
      - name: "Power Outage Status"
        unique_id: power_outage_status
        state: >
          {% set now_hour = now().hour %}
          {% if 14 <= now_hour < 16 %}
            on
          {% else %}
            off
          {% endif %}
      
      # Outage End Time
      - name: "Power Outage End Time"
        unique_id: power_outage_end_time
        state: >
          {% set today = now().date() %}
          {{ today.replace(hour=16, minute=0).isoformat() }}
      
      # Next Outage Time
      - name: "Next Power Outage"
        unique_id: next_power_outage
        state: >
          {% set today = now().date() %}
          {% set now_hour = now().hour %}
          {% if now_hour < 14 %}
            {{ today.replace(hour=14, minute=0).isoformat() }}
          {% else %}
            {{ (today + timedelta(days=1)).replace(hour=14, minute=0).isoformat() }}
          {% endif %}
```

#### Example 2: Integration with External API

If you have an integration that provides outage data (e.g., utility company API):

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
template:
  - sensor:
      - name: "Outage Status"
        state: "{{ states('binary_sensor.utility_outage') }}"
      
      - name: "Outage End Time"
        state: "{{ state_attr('sensor.utility_data', 'outage_end') }}"
      
      - name: "Next Outage Time"
        state: "{{ state_attr('sensor.utility_data', 'next_outage_start') }}"
```

#### Example 3: Yasno Integration (Ukrainian DTEK)

If you're using the [**HA Yasno Outages**](https://github.com/denysdovhan/ha-yasno-outages) integration by [@denysdovhan](https://github.com/denysdovhan) for Ukrainian electricity outage tracking (DTEK), you can use the sensors directly:

```yaml
type: custom:smart-battery-card
batteries:
  - entity: sensor.delta_2_main_battery_level
    name: EcoFlow Delta 2
    remaining_time_entity: sensor.delta_2_discharge_remaining_time
    charge_remaining_time_entity: sensor.delta_2_charge_remaining_time
    ac_out_power_entity: sensor.delta_2_ac_out_power

# Yasno/DTEK sensors (replace with your city/group)
outage_status_entity: sensor.yasno_kiiv_dtek_2_2_electricity
outage_end_time_entity: sensor.yasno_kiiv_dtek_2_2_next_connectivity
next_outage_time_entity: sensor.yasno_kiiv_dtek_2_2_next_planned_outage
```

**Installation:** Install [HA Yasno Outages](https://github.com/denysdovhan/ha-yasno-outages) via HACS. After setup, it provides sensors for electricity status, connectivity times, and planned outages. Entity names vary by city and DTEK group (e.g., `yasno_kiiv_dtek_2_2` for Kyiv, Group 2.2).

### Full Card Configuration with Outage Features

```yaml
type: custom:smart-battery-card
batteries:
  - entity: sensor.ecoflow_battery_level
    name: "EcoFlow Delta 2"
    remaining_time_entity: sensor.delta_2_discharge_remaining_time
    charge_remaining_time_entity: sensor.delta_2_charge_remaining_time
    ac_out_power_entity: sensor.delta_2_ac_out_power

# Outage integration sensors
outage_status_entity: sensor.power_outage_status
outage_end_time_entity: sensor.power_outage_end_time
next_outage_time_entity: sensor.next_power_outage

# Display settings
green: 80
yellow: 40
palette: gradient
```

### Understanding the Analysis

The card provides intelligent analysis and warnings:

#### 🔴 **Critical Alert** (Red, Pulsing)
```
⚠️ Battery may run out 45m before outage ends!
```
**What it means**: Your battery's remaining discharge time is less than the outage duration. You need to reduce power consumption or the battery will die before power returns.

**Action**: Turn off non-essential devices immediately.

#### 🟡 **Warning** (Yellow)
```
⚡ Battery sufficient, but only 15m spare time
```
**What it means**: Battery will last through the outage, but with less than 30 minutes buffer.

**Action**: Monitor your power usage carefully. Consider turning off some devices.

#### 🔵 **Info** (Blue)
```
⏰ Start charging soon - 1h 15m margin
```
**What it means**: You have time to charge, but not much extra time. You should start charging within the next hour.

**Action**: Connect to power and start charging if not already doing so.

#### 🟢 **OK** (Green)
```
✅ Battery sufficient for outage (1h 23m spare)
```
**What it means**: You're all set! Battery will comfortably last through the outage.

**Action**: No immediate action needed.

### Charging Time Analysis

The card uses your EcoFlow's `charge_remaining_time_entity` sensor for accurate charging time predictions. This is more accurate than calculations because it accounts for:
- Current charging power (varies with AC/solar/car input)
- Battery temperature and condition
- Charging curve (batteries charge slower near 100%)
- Real-time charging rate

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Configure All Sensors**: For best analysis, configure all three time sensors:
   - `remaining_time_entity` - Battery discharge time
   - `charge_remaining_time_entity` - Battery charge time
   - Both sensors enable accurate outage vs battery analysis

2. **Reliable Outage Data**: Ensure your outage sensors provide accurate information
   - Use official utility company integrations (like Yasno for Ukraine)
   - Verify timezone configuration in Home Assistant
   - Test sensors before relying on them during outages

3. **Safety Margins**: The card recommends charging when there's still time margin
   - ✅ Green status: 30+ minutes spare time
   - ⚠️ Warning: Less than 30 minutes spare time
   - Plan to start charging before warnings appear

4. **Power Consumption**: The analysis is based on current usage
   - High AC output = faster battery drain = shorter remaining time
   - Turn off non-essential devices during critical situations
   - Monitor the AC output power display

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Card Not Showing
- Ensure the resource is properly added to your Lovelace configuration
- Check the browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the entity exists and has a numeric state or battery/level attribute

### Wrong Battery Reading
- Check if your sensor reports values in the expected range (0-100)
- If your sensor reports inversely (0=full, 100=empty), set `invert: true`
- Verify the entity name is correct in your configuration

### Styling Issues
- Clear your browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
- Check if your Home Assistant theme defines the required CSS custom properties

### Outage Features Not Working
- **No outage information showing**: Verify that your outage sensor entities exist and have valid states
  - Check sensor states in Developer Tools → States
  - Ensure entity IDs match your configuration exactly
- **Wrong outage times**: Check datetime format in your sensors
  - Use ISO format: `2025-11-13T14:30:00` or Unix timestamps
  - Verify your timezone is configured correctly in Home Assistant
  - Check Developer Tools → States to verify sensor values
- **Analysis messages not appearing**:
  - Ensure `charge_remaining_time_entity` is configured for charging analysis
  - Ensure `remaining_time_entity` is configured for discharge analysis
  - Check that time sensors report values in minutes (not seconds/hours)
  - Verify outage status sensor returns 'on'/'off' or similar states
  - Use Developer Tools → States to verify all sensor states
