# Changelog

All notable changes to the Smart Battery Card will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-14

### 🎉 Rebranding

#### Name Change
- **Renamed Project**: "EcoFlow Battery Card" → "Smart Battery Card"
  - More generic name reflects universal battery support
  - Works with any battery sensor: EcoFlow, Jackery, Tesla Powerwall, etc.
  - Custom element renamed: `custom:eco-battery-card` → `custom:smart-battery-card`
  - File renamed: `eco-battery-card.js` → `smart-battery-card.js`

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes
- **Custom Element Name**: You must update your configuration from `type: custom:eco-battery-card` to `type: custom:smart-battery-card`
- **File Name**: Update HACS or manual installation to use `smart-battery-card.js`

## [0.3.0] - 2025-11-13

### ✨ Major Features - Multi-Battery Support

#### Vertical Battery Layout
- **Complete UI Redesign**: Batteries now display vertically with bottom-to-top fill
  - Battery segments fill from bottom like real batteries charging
  - Each battery has its own status circle below
  - Battery names displayed at the top of each unit
  - Clean, minimal design with no distracting animations
  
#### Multi-Battery Display
- **Support for Multiple Batteries**: Add as many EcoFlow devices as you want!
  - Dynamic layout that auto-adjusts based on battery count:
    - 1 battery: Centered display
    - 2 batteries: Left and right placement
    - 3+ batteries: Distributed grid layout
  - Each battery shows independently:
    - Battery name
    - Percentage level
    - Remaining time (charge or discharge)
    - Power output
    - Status indicator (charging/discharging/idle)
  - Auto-adjusting card height for optimal display

#### Selected Battery Analysis
- **Outage Analysis Selection**: Choose which battery to monitor for outages
  - New `selected_battery` config option (0 = first, 1 = second, etc.)
  - Outage warnings reference the battery by name
  - Example: "⚠️ Delta 2 may run out before outage ends"
  - Unified outage display for all batteries

### 🔄 Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Configuration Structure Changed**

**Old Format (v0.2.x):**
```yaml
entity: sensor.battery_level
name: My Battery
remaining_time_entity: sensor.discharge_time
```

**New Format (v0.3.0+):**
```yaml
batteries:
  - entity: sensor.battery_level
    name: My Battery
    remaining_time_entity: sensor.discharge_time
```

**Migration**: Simply wrap your battery configuration in a `batteries` array!

#### Removed Options
- `charge_rate_watts`: No longer needed (card uses sensor directly)
- `battery_capacity_wh`: No longer needed (card uses sensor directly)
- `outage_schedule_entity`: Already removed in v0.2.1

### 📝 Changed

#### Configuration
- **New Structure**: `batteries` array replaces single `entity` config
- **Battery Object Properties**: Each battery has its own config:
  - `entity` (required): Battery level sensor
  - `name` (optional): Display name
  - `remaining_time_entity` (optional): Discharge time
  - `charge_remaining_time_entity` (optional): Charge time
  - `ac_out_power_entity` (optional): Power output
  - `invert` (optional): Invert reading
  
#### Visual Design
- Battery orientation: horizontal → vertical
- Fill direction: left-to-right → bottom-to-top
- Status indicator: right side → below battery
- Layout: single horizontal → dynamic multi-battery
- Energy flow animations: removed for cleaner, more minimal design

#### Internal Improvements
- Refactored `render()` method for multi-battery support
- New helper methods:
  - `_renderSingleBattery()`: Renders individual battery
  - `_renderVerticalEnergyFlow()`: Downward particle animation
  - `_renderVerticalStatusIndicator()`: Status circle below battery
- Updated `getCardSize()` to dynamically adjust based on battery count
- Modified `_pct()`, `_remainingTime()`, `_acOutPower()` to accept battery index
- Updated `_analyzeOutageSituation()` to use selected battery

### 🎨 Improved

- All CSS now has `-webkit-` prefixes for iOS Safari compatibility
- Flexbox properties properly prefixed
- Animations work smoothly on mobile devices
- Better layout handling with `box-sizing: border-box`
- Text wrapping with `word-break: break-word`

#### CSS & Animations

## Migration Guide

### From v0.1.x to v0.2.0

Version 0.2.0 is **fully backward compatible**. All existing configurations will continue to work without any changes.

#### To Enable Outage Features:

1. **Create outage sensors** in your Home Assistant configuration (see README for examples)

2. **Add outage entities** to your card configuration:
```yaml
outage_status_entity: sensor.outage_status
outage_end_time_entity: sensor.outage_end_time
next_outage_time_entity: sensor.next_outage_time
outage_schedule_entity: sensor.outage_schedule
```

3. **Configure battery specs** (optional, for accurate calculations):
```yaml
charge_rate_watts: 1200  # Your charger's wattage
battery_capacity_wh: 1024  # Your battery's capacity
```

That's it! The card will automatically show outage information when configured.
